    "\n",
    "For layout and styling related parameters see the [customization user guide](../../user_guide/Customization.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **``axes``** (dict): A dictionary with the parameters of the axes to construct in the 3d view.\n",
    "    Must contain at least ``xticker``, ``yticker`` and ``zticker``.\n",
    "    - ``[x|y|z]ticker`` is a dictionary which contains:\n",

    "        If `labels` are not defined they are infered from the `ticks` array.\n",

    "    - ``fontsize``: size in pts of the ticks labels.\n",
    "    - ``show_grid``: boolean. If true (default) the axes grid is visible.\n",
    "    - ``grid_opacity``: float between 0-1. Defines the grid opacity.\n",

    "* **``camera``** (dict): A dictionary reflecting the current state of the VTK camera\n",
    "* **``enable_keybindings``** (bool): A boolean to activate/deactivate keybindings. Bound keys are:\n",

    "\n",
    "* **``synchronize()``** : Sychronize the modifications of the ``vtkRenderWindow``\n",

    "* **``unlink_camera()``** : Create a new vtkCamera object, allowing to the panel to have it's own camera.\n",
